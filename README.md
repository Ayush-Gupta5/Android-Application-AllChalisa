# Android-Application-AllChalisa
I developed a Android application "All Chalisa" by using Java.

1. The "All Chalisa" Android application is a mobile app designed to provide users with easy access to a collection of Chalisas, which are devotional hymns or prayers that hold significant importance in various Hindu traditions.
2. User can access the text of the Chalisas, complete with lyrics in the original Hindi script.
3. "All Chalisa" offers audio recitations of Chalisas, allowing users to listen to the chants and prayers, which can be helpful for those who are not familiar with the correct pronunciation.
4. Users can download Chalisas and access them offline, ensuring that they can use the app even when they don't have an internet connection.
5. User can also be share this app by sharing application download link through social media or messaging platforms.
